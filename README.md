# 1. Requirements

### The system must have 2 types of users: Clients and Administrators

Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The application already comes with an account admin with password admin.

Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.

The admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email.

Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, address, phone, email

Product/services records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), quantity sold.
Your store may sell products, services or both (you decide)

### Selling Products (or services): 

Products are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Products are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of product sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.

### Product/Service Management: 
Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.

### Your functionality: 
Our current idea is for the user to be able to see a 3d model of the product you want to buy

### The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability. The system must be responsive.


# 2. Project Description
Our project is a sports products store. It allows admins and clients to login and clients to create their own account.

The clients are presented to the products of the store and are allowed to add them to their cart, change their personal data and buy the products on the cart.

The admins are allowed to change their personal data, register new admins and clients and manage the products of the store.
